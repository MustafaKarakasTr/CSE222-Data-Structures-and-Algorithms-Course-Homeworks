when the program starts, it executes part 1 and part 2 in order.
In part2:
	put method tries puting the new element to the (its hashcode % table length )th position.
	if the index is full, it checks the positions whose indexes increment proportional to the n^2.
	
	for( 1 to n)
		index += n^2
		if(index is available)
			break

	remove method:
		removes the specified element and it places the next element to deleted element's space recursively.
